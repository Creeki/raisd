In RSDPatternPool_pushSNP:
1. check if SNP is indeed SNP before pushing it
2. check if incoming SNP location is valid
3. properly handle ambiguity (once fixed, correct in the getNextSNP functions for ms and VCF) and add assertion check again - check also in VCF parsing
4. Fixed output reports
5. Create eval functions for distance, success, tpr
6. what should we do with the FSM?
7. Fix testing input flags
8. parallelize pattern matching in patternPool_pushSNP
