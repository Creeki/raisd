About
-----

RAiSD (Raised Accuracy in Sweep Detection) is a stand-alone software implementation of the μ statistic for selective sweep detection. Unlike existing implementations, including our previously released tools (SweeD and OmegaPlus), RAiSD scans whole-genome SNP data based on a composite evaluation scheme that captures multiple sweep signatures at once. 

Download and Compile
--------------------

The following commands can be used to download and compile the source code. 

    $ mkdir RAiSD
    $ cd RAiSD
    $ wget https://github.com/alachins/raisd/archive/master.zip
    $ unzip master.zip
    $ cd raisd-master
    $ make
    
The executable is placed in the path RAiSD/raisd-master/bin/release. A link to the executable is placed in the installation folder, i.e., raisd-master.

Test Run
--------

To verify that RAiSD is installed correctly, a test run can be done with the following commands. These commands are going to download a dataset (one of the many that we used for evaluation purposes) and execute RAiSD to process 1,000 simulated sets of SNPs (genomic region size = 100000 bp, weak bottleneck, selective sweep at the center of the region).
    
    $ wget 139.91.162.50/raisd_data/d1.tar.gz
    $ tar -xvzf d1.tar.gz
    $ ./RAiSD -n test_run -I d1/msselection1.out -L 100000
    
Upon completion, two output file are generated: RAiSD_Info.test_run and RAiSD_Report.test_run. 
    
In-tool Help
------------

RAiSD outputs a quick-reference help message that provides a short description for each of the supported command-line flags with the following command. 

    $ RAiSD -h
    
The quick-reference help message generated by the current RAiSD release is the following.

    This is RAiSD version 1.0, released in June 2017.

     RAiSD
         -n STRING
         -I STRING
        [-L INTEGER]
        [-h]
        [-f]
        [-s]
        [-t]
        [-p]
        [-S STRING]
        [-T INTEGER]
        [-d INTEGER]
        [-k FLOATING-POINT]
        [-l FLOATING-POINT]

     -n	Provides a unique run ID that is used to name the output files, i.e., the info file and the report(s).
     -I	Provides the path to the input file, which can be either in ms or in vcf format.
     -L	Provides the size of the region in basepairs for ms files. If known, it can be used for vcf as well, leading to faster processing.
     -h	Prints this help message.
     -f	Overwrites existing run files under the same run ID.
     -s	Generates a separate report file per set.
     -t	Removes the set separator symbol from the report(s).
     -p	Generates the output file RAiSD_Samples.STRING, where STRING is the run ID, comprising a list of samples in the input file (supported only with VCF).
     -S	Provides the path to the list of samples to be processed (supported only with VCF).
     -T	Provides the selection target (in basepairs) and calculates the average distance (over all datasets in the input file) between the selection target and the reported locations.
     -d	Provides a maximum distance (in base pairs, from the selection target) to calculate success rate in terms of reported locations in the proximity of the target of selection (provided via -T).
     -k	Provides the false positive rate (e.g., 0.05) to report the corresponding reported score after sorting the reported locations for all the datasets in the input file.
     -l	Provides the threshold score, reported by a previous run using a false positive rate (e.g., 0.05, via -k) to report the true positive rate.

    
Input File Formats
----------------------

The current RAiSD release can process SNP data in Hudson's ms or VCF (Variant Call Format) file formats. The d1 test dataset, previously used for the test run, is in Hudson's ms format. For the VCF format, refer to the respective Wikipedia entry (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variant_Call_Format).

Output Files
------------

RAiSD generates two output files, the RAiSD_Info and the RAiSD_Report, with the run name (provided via "-n") as file extension. 

RAiSD_Info.test_run

The RAiSD_Info file provides execution- and dataset-related information (command line, number of samples, region size, dataset format), as well as a result line per SNP set in the input file. Each per-set result line provides the following information:
a) set index, b) number of sites, c) number of SNPs, d) region size, e) best-score location and the respective score for each of the factors that form the μ statistic, denoted as VAR, SFS, and LD, and f) best-score location and the respective score for the μ statistic (MuStat).

The RAiSD_Info file additionally reports total execution time, memory footprint, and statistics about the total number of SNP sets in the input file (total, processed, skipped), as shown in the last 6 lines of the file.

    Sets (total):     1000
    Sets (processed): 1000
    Sets (skipped):   0

    Total execution time 32.03070 seconds
    Total memory footprint 1109 kbytes

For each set of SNPs (separated by a line that contains the separator symbol "//" followed by the set index), the RAiSD_Report file contains a set of result lines, one per evaluated genomic location, with each result line providing the genomic location followed by the calculated statistic values for the factors VAR, SFS, and LD, and finally the μ statistic. 
    
 

Required Input Parameters
-------------------------

The in-tool help message generates a list of parameters, as shown above. Those in brackets are optional.
    
    The basic execution mode does NOT require any FREE input parameters. 
   
In addition to the run name ("-n", used to name the output files accordingly) and the path to the input file ("-I") containing SNP data, the region length ("-L") is required only when simulated data are processed, i.e., ms files. The region length, which is required for calculating the μ statistic is extracted from the input file prior to processing when VCF files are analyzed. 

The following command lines provide two examples of command lines for processing ms and VCF files.

Hudson's ms format

    $ ./RAiSD -n ms_run -I input_file.ms -L 1000000

VCF format

    $ ./RAiSD -n vcf_run -I input_file.vcf


Optional Input Parameters
------------------------

In addition to the required set of parameters, several optional ones can be used. The in-tool help message provides a short description for each one of them.
