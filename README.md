About
-----

RAiSD (Raised Accuracy in Sweep Detection) is a stand-alone software implementation of the Î¼ statistic for selective sweep detection. Unlike existing implementations, including our previously released tools (SweeD and OmegaPlus), RAiSD scans whole-genome SNP data based on a composite evaluation scheme that captures multiple sweep signatures at once.
